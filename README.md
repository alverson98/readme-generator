# README.md Generator: readme-generator

Module 9 - Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

---

## Description
This application is a markdown file generator, specifically to create README.md files. The purpose of this project was to practice recently learned skills when working with the inquirer package and creating unit tests. The main goal was to use inquirer to prompt users to answer questions and use their responses to create a README.md file for their application. Since this application does not exist in the browser, it was a challenge having to use unit tests to test my code. It's a complete different way of thinking, and this project did a great job challenging those skills.

### Requirements

A list of requirements derived from acceptance criteria and personal goals:

- README.md file created with the sections Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. 
- Answers from the user updates the corresponding sections of the README.
- Chosen license badges are displayed on the top of the README, along with license name listed in the License section.
- Links in the Table of Contents take you to that corresponding section.


### Skills Learned/ Improved

Here is a list of some skills I learned and/or improved throughout this project:

- Javascript
- Terminal commands
- Installing needed packages/ dependencies
- Using inquirer to prompt user with questions in the terminal
- Node.js
- Unit tests

Tools used to complete this project:

- VS Code
- Terminal
- GitHub
- Inquirer

## Usage

This application is used to create a README.md file for any project that someone may be working on. It works by prompting the user with multiple questions about the various information that is typically included on a README.md file. Then those user responses are used to render the file contents and then creates the README.md file in a separate folder. See the following screenshots for examples of the application's use and results.

This is the terminal built in VS code once the application is initiated. Once the questions are answered, the terminal will display a "Success!" or Error message depending on the status of the file.

Then the README-demo folder will contain the newly created README.md file. It can be viewed either as the raw form or as a preview. It is recommended to add more detail to the documents such as any deployed links, screenshots, etc. after using this application.

Here is the raw example:
